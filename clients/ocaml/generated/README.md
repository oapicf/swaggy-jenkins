opam install . --deps-only --with-test
eval $(opam env)
dune build
```

## Getting Started

The generated directory structure is:
- `src/apis`: contains several modules, each with several functions. Each function is an API endpoint.
- `src/models`: contains several modules. Each module contains:
  - a type `t` representing an input and/or output schema of the OpenAPI spec
  - a smart constructor `create` for this type
- `src/support`: various modules used by the generated APIs and Models
